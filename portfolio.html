					<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p>We at Google Drive Upload Bot understand your concern about how we share, secure and use the information you have
shared with us when you visit the website Google Drive Upload Bot.com (our “Website”) and use our services. Our Privacy
Policy makes it clear how that information is handled at our end, and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining,
protecting and disclosing that information. We adhere to what we say in this Privacy Policy.
Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.
If you do not agree with our policies and practices, you can choose not to use our Website. By accessing or using our
Website, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of the Website after
we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.
Notes: After authorization, Google Drive Upload Bot accesses the data in the user's cloud drive (Google Drive, Google
Photos, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.) without saving the contents. All operations on the user data are based-on the API interface
provided by the cloud disk. Therefore, Google Drive Upload Bot plays just as a bridge to connect one cloud storage to
another.</p>
<h3>01. INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</h3>
<p>Customer-Provided Information: To use Google Drive Upload Bot services, you may first download the Google Drive
Upload Bot application (the “App”). To download the App, you will be requested to provide certain information. We will retain
your email identification provided at the time of sign-up or App download, email messages we receive from you and the
responses given to you by Google Drive Upload Bot. If you recommend someone to Google Drive Upload Bot, we will use
the provided email address exclusively to send an invitation to that person.
Cookies Information: When you visit Google Drive Upload Bot.com, we send one or more cookies (a text file including a
few alphanumeric characters) to your system to identify your browser. Cookies we send do not pick-up any of your personal
information. Google Drive Upload Bot sends two types of cookies – persistent cookies (those that continue to exist in your
hard drive even after closing your browser) and the session cookies (temporary cookies that get deleted after closing your
browser). Persistent cookies are used by your browser for subsequent visits to Google Drive Upload Bot. Your web browser
can be reset to reject Google Drive Upload Bot cookies or to alert you when a cookie is sent to the browser. Rejecting the
cookies may not allow all features of our Website to function properly.
Log File Information: Your browser sends certain information to our servers every time you access the Website. This
information is automatically recorded by our servers. The server log file includes information such as IP address, browser
type, web request from your browser, referring or exit pages, number of clicks, landing pages, URLs, pages viewed and
other related information.
Clear Gifs Information: When you use the Google Drive Upload Bot Website, we use clear gifs (also known as Web
Beacons) to keep track of your online usage pattern and to check which of the emails sent by us are opened by you. Our
Web Beacons do not collect any of your personal information from your Google Drive Upload Bot account. Information
collected by clear gifs enables us to assess and improve marketing strategies and make Google Drive Upload Bot serve you
in a better way.</p>
<h3>02. HOW GOOGLE DRIVE UPLOAD BOT USES THE INFORMATION THAT
WE COLLECT</h3>
<p>Automatically Recorded Information: Google Drive Upload Bot uses automatically recorded information only for the
internal purpose of managing our Website and providing you a better user experience. Google Drive Upload Bot uses clear
gifs, cookies and log file content to:
. Retain information about you so as to prevent you from re-entering the information every time you view the web page
. Provide personalized information
. Keep track of the efficiency of our service
. Analyze the total number of visitors to the Website and the traffic
. Identify and resolve technical problems reported by customers or engineers related to IP addresses regulated by a
specific web company or an internet service provider.
User-Provided Information: We may convert or combine some personal information of users into de-identified or
aggregated data that does not disclose any of the personal information of any individual user. We may use any such deidentified or aggregated data without restriction.
If you purchase products or services, we may transmit your personal information to payment processors. We may also use
your personal information to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between
you and us, including for billing and collection.

at the end of every email that we send to you. Users who prefer not to receive messages from Google Drive Upload Bot can
unsubscribe or alter mailing priorities by posting a request to us. Unsubscribing prevents you from obtaining email messages
related to special offers and updates to the service.
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active and for a short period thereafter in case you choose to
reactivate your account. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you
services, you may delete your account. We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal
obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your
